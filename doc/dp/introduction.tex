\label{chap:introduction}

\begin{itemize}
\item give some interoduction about importance of genome assembly, as all works of this type usualy do,
\item define basic terms, such as reference sequence, active region, k-mer, read, base quality, CIGAR string or variant,
\item describe current and past approaches for doing genome assembly (AllPath, Euler, Velvet, possibly others. Also HaploCall since it forms a starting point for this thesis). 
\item formulate the problem this thesis works on,
\end{itemize}
