\begin{itemize}
\item describe the data set used for tests and its sources,
\item describe algorithms and software to evaluate the results (fermikit, fermikit run at individual regions, GATK, mpileup of samtools, rtgeval for evaluation),
\item Show the position-based and genotype results of rtgeval.
\item describe interesting variants (variants that are not found by other software, explain some false negatives, demonstrate that graph optimizations actually revealed some variants...).
